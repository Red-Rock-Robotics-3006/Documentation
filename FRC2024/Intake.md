| DESIGN | UtB | Handoff | Continuous OTB |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| PROS | No extension mechanism, pretty good funneling / width, simple transfer  | Simple, compact, less transfer design | Fast, grabs from weird corners, touch it own it |
| CONS | More complex bumper design, constrained space | Slow, lots of run cycles, lots of continuous stress | Constrained by swerve module width/height, same stress issues as handoff, harder transfer design |
