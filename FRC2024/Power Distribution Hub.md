- The PDH has numerous steps that can be taken to improve [power efficiency](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10e2XhWHuQAMITqhQhHZRlX1Y5KAZNquZ/view):
	- Prioritize power ports close to battery connection (0, 1, 18, 19) for lower resistance
	- Measure resistance of REV 40A ATO breakers, bin breakers with resistance above ~1.5 milliohms (keep as suboptimal spares?)
