What we've seen:
- Shooting for the speaker is fairly easy, a simple flywheel mechanism or even horizontal rollers is enough to launch the note
- Shooting can be done from various places with an angle-able shooter
- Amp is fairly hard to get notes into without a dedicated mechanism, a shooter can get notes in consistently by using a blocking bar to stop notes from regurgitating
- Note intake isn't too bad as notes can be safely squeezed and bent a large amount
- Notes are somewhat self-centering when intaking
- Climbing on its own is easy, doing things while climbing is very hard
- Polybelts and regular compliant wheels work well for note transferring
